# RAT
Remote Audio Transfer

Functionality
-------------
RAT is an application to move high quality audio over the internet. It will apply minimal processing and provide configurable latency and quality priority.

This is a tool to replace Skype or other VOIP services for podcasters and musicians. It circumvents undesirable compression artifacts and ducking and provides a clean input to be mixed exactly like any other in-studio source.

Planned Features
----------

- Send audio over the internet using UDP
- Send multiple channels from the same source to the same destination
- Customizable latency and quality settings
- Level display and metering with a customizable monitor mix
- Master and slave mode for remote administration
